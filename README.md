# 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Wham ([@techneware](https://github.com/techneware))

I’m a full-stack .NET developer with over 20 years of experience modernizing legacy systems, building backend services, and developing internal tools using C#, VB.NET, and SQL Server. I got my start programming on TRS-80 Color Computers using line-numbered BASIC, and deepened my skills in C, Pascal, and Assembly while studying robotics and electronics at Albuquerque TV-I. These early foundations shaped my passion for building reliable, purpose-driven software — a focus I've carried forward through projects in e-commerce, warehousing, and public sector systems.

## 🚀 What I Do
- Refactor and maintain legacy systems using **C#, VB.NET, .NET Framework**, and **NServiceBus**  
- Build tools for **order fulfillment, inventory, and shipping workflows** (including packing stations and real-time dashboards)  
- Integrate with third-party systems like **UPS, FedEx, ShipEngine**, and legacy accounting platforms  
- Write and optimize **SQL Server** queries, stored procedures, and reporting flows  
- Explore new techniques through personal projects and coding challenges

*Note: I do not currently have experience with CI/CD or containerization, but I’m actively learning about them through personal study.*

## 📂 About This GitHub

While most of my professional work is proprietary, this GitHub includes a few representative and learning-oriented projects:

- 🔧 [`SmarterMail.Cli`](https://github.com/techneware/SmarterMail.Cli): A small C# CLI utility for interacting with SmarterMail's API  
- 🎄 [`AdventOfCode2021`](https://github.com/techneware/AdventOfCode2021): My C# solutions for Advent of Code 2021  
- 🎄 [`AdventOfCode2024`](https://github.com/techneware/AdventOfCode2024): My C# solutions for Advent of Code 2024  
- 🧮 [`MathApp`](https://github.com/techneware/MathApp): A lightweight math-focused application prototype to demonstrate OOP concepts

I use this space to practice modern syntax, test utility ideas, and explore algorithmic challenges in a way that complements my production experience.
